    "To calculate advanced metrics such as Efficiency, Win Shares, Player Impact Estimate (PIE), Offensive and Defensive Ratings, and Pace, you will typically need detailed play-by-play data and box score statistics. Some of these metrics can be complex, as they require a combination of multiple statistical elements and sometimes proprietary formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief overview of how you might approach each one:\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency (Team Efficiency Rating)\n",
    "Team Efficiency Rating is not an official NBA statistic and can vary depending on the formula you use. A simple version might be points scored minus points allowed, divided by possessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Win Shares\n",
    "Win Shares is a player statistic that attempts to divvy up credit for team success to the individuals on the team. It's calculated using player, team, and league statistics and is quite complex. You may need to rely on a data provider to supply win shares unless you want to implement the full calculation yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Player Impact Estimate (PIE)\n",
    "PIE measures a player's overall statistical contribution against the total statistics in games they play in. The formula for PIE is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "plaintext\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "PIE = (Player Stats) / (Team Stats + Opponent Stats)\n",
    "Each \"Player Stats\" and \"Team Stats\" category includes points, field goals made, free throws made, defensive rebounds, offensive rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and turnovers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Offensive and Defensive Ratings\n",
    "These are estimates of a team's performance per 100 possessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Offensive Rating (ORtg) is the number of points a team scores per 100 possessions.\n",
    "Defensive Rating (DRtg) is the number of points a team allows per 100 possessions.\n",
    "To calculate these, you typically need box score data and possession estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pace\n",
    "Pace factor is an estimate of the number of possessions per 48 minutes by a team. A commonly used formula for pace is:\n",
    "\n",
    "plaintext\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "Pace = 48 * ((Tm Poss + Opp Poss) / (2 * (Tm MP / 5)))\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tm Poss is an estimate of the team's possessions\n",
    "Opp Poss is an estimate of the opponent's possessions\n",
    "Tm MP is the minutes played, which is typically 240 for a regulation game\n",
    "To get these metrics using nba_api, you can use endpoints such as teamgamelog for game-by-game statistics, boxscoreadvancedv2 for advanced box scores, and leaguegamelog for league-wide game logs. However, due to the complexity and proprietary nature of some of these statistics, you may also want to consider paid data services that provide these metrics pre-calculated."
